## However, in ggplot2 these specifications are individual-variable-to-individual-visual-channel which does not lend itself easily to visualizations in the world of dimension reduction (e.g. PCA, T-sne, UMAP).

The usual one-var-to-one-aesthetic requirement means that it may not feel obvious how to extend ggplot2 for dimensionality reduction visualization, which deals with characterizing *many* variables. 

So while using ggplot2 under-the-hood is common in the dim-red space, it feels like there may be less consistency across dim-red APIs.  


---


At the same time, these techniques are all in the same space,

- McInnes Bluffer’s guide https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iol3Lk6kyU


---

So why shouldn't we be able to 'talk' about them in the same way - even when it comes to encoding the plot.

# And what if we could do this in the grammar of graphics ggplot2 paradigm?

"People like to click buttons"

"People like to use ggplot2" (like to build up plots incrementally using intuitive syntax)

---

```{r, eval = F}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = my_high_dimensional_data) + 
  aes(dims = 
        dims(var1:var200, var205)
      ) +      
  geom_dimred_technique()                 
```




---


For users of these APIs, getting quickly acquainted with techniques (students) or doing comparative work (practitioners) may be more challenging than it needs to be. The {ggdims} package explores a new `dims()` and `dims_expand()` utility that could help with greater consistency across dim-red APIs, with standard ggplots, and within the ggplot2 extension ecosystem.
